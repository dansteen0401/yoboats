				<p style="color: #062f75">James:  I like using the site. Whatever I need a boat for a specific job I am able to find boats that are outfitted the right way. If we need a roller on the stern, a lot of times these boat owners will stay in communication and outfit the vessel the correct way. This is a life saver in my world.</p>

				<p style="color: #067515">Wil: I am in the commercial and oil and gas marine industry. Typically we don't use both sites to do a sales. Since I found this site has become a huge resource. I find the boat that I need just about every time. I don't have to worry about questions of safety, fire equipment, and environmental equipment. All I have to do is ask for the documentation and they send it every time.</p>
